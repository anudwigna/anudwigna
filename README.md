üßë‚Äçüè´ In my professional career, my area of expertise lies in **Full Stack Web Application Development**. Alongside this, I have a strong passion for the fields of AI/ML, specifically in **Deep Learning** and **NLP**.

üèì When it comes to my interests, I find great joy in coding and immersing myself in music. Beyond the realm of technology, I am an avid reader, indulging in books üìñ.
